Most recently, she is on a team that received over $15 million from NSF for their "Named Data Networking" project. As an active member of the research community, she has served on the program committee of more than 50 conferences and workshops. She is also interested in promoting female participation in computer science, co-organizing a "Networking Networking Women" panel at ACM SIGCOMM 2008 and an N2Women dinner at ACM SIGCOMM 2019. She started and has been advising the Women in Computing student chapter at the university. Dr. Wang is an IEEE Senior Member. She received the 2010 Early Career Research Award from the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Memphis and 2019 Alumni Association Distinguished Research Award in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics from the University of Memphis.

							<h5>Co-Primary Investigator</h5>
							<p style="line-height: 1.2;"><strong>Director, MD2K Center of Excellence;<br />Professor &amp; Lillian and Morrie Moss Chair of Excellence in Computer Science, University of Memphis</strong></p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4em;">Santosh Kumar is the Lillian and Morrie Moss Chair of Excellence Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Memphis. Santosh has been leading large multidisciplinary mobile health (mHealth) projects since 2007, sponsored by NSF and NIH. He is currently leading an NIH Center of Excellence on Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K), a truly transdisciplinary project in which Santosh leads a team of 20+ investigators from 12 universities who come from diverse but complementary disciplines including computer science, engineering, statistics, public health, medicine, and behavioral science. His work has led to the development of novel sensor-derived mHealth biomarkers such as stress, conversation, smoking, craving, cocaine use, brushing, and flossing. In addition to direct experience with leading transdisciplinary mobile sensor research projects, Santosh has led national efforts to advance the field of mHealth. He has chaired national meetings on mHealth Evidence and on identifying computing grand challenges in mHealth.

							<h3><strong>Lixia Zhang</strong></h3>
							<h5>Co-Primary Investigator</h5>
							<p style="line-height: 1.2;"><strong>Jonathan B. Postel Professor of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</strong></p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4em;">Lixia Zhang is a professor in the Computer Science Department of UCLA. She received Ph.D in computer science from MIT and was a member of the research staff at Xerox PARC. Dr. Zhang joined the faculty of UCLA Computer Science Department in 1995. Her research at UCLA started with Adaptive Web Caching (AWC), the design of a global scale web caching system funded by DARPA, and the Internet Distance Map Service funded by NSF. From 1998 to 2010 much of her group's research focus was on the resiliency and security issues in the global routing system and Domain Name System (DNS), and the system challenges in deploying cryptographic protections in global scale open systems such as the Internet. Her group developed several useful tools that got widely used by the Internet research and operational communities. Dr. Zhang coined the term "middlebox" to refer to a computer networking device that performs functions other than that of a regular Internet protocol router. Examples of middleboxes include firewalls and network address translators. Her term has been widely adopted by the industry. Since 2010, she has been leading a multi-campus research project on the development of a new Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN) funded by NSF.
